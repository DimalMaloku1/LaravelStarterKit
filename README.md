Welcome to your Laravel Beginner's Project! This repository is meant to help you get started with the Laravel framework, one of the most popular PHP frameworks for web development. 🚀

## Getting Started 🛠️

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine using XAMPP:

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (or any other local development environment that includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache)

### Installation ⚙️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laravel-beginner.git
   cd laravel-beginner
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. Update the necessary environment variables such as database connection settings.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Generate a new application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Run the database migrations to create the required tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. Finally, start the development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

Congratulations! You now have a basic Laravel project up and running using XAMPP. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to access the application. 🎉
